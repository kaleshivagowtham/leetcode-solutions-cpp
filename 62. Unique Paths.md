# 62. Unique Paths

# Approach
First let us build a matrix of `m x n` dimenssions.
The number of ways from each block in the matrix should be the sum of the number of ways from its right block + from its below block,
i.e. `no. of ways from i,j` = `no. of ways from i+1,j` + `no. of ways from i,j+1`.

But this would have recursive issue, so we will update the no. of ways from each block to the right most at that block itself.
And we start from the right-bottom block`i.e. [m-1][n-1]`, so as to write a memoization based code.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(m*n)

- Space complexity: O(m*n)

# Code
```
class Solution {
    int traveller(int i, int j, int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& memo) {

        if(i == m-1 && j == n-1){
            return 1;
        }

        if( i >= m || j >= n)
            return 0;

        int val1 = i+1 < m && memo[i+1][j] ? memo[i+1][j] : traveller(i+1, j, m, n, memo);
        int val2 = j+1 < n && memo[i][j+1] ? memo[i][j+1] : traveller(i, j+1, m, n, memo);

        return val1 + val2;
    }

public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> memo(m, vector<int> (n, 0));

        for(int i=m-1; i>=0; i--){
            for(int j=n-1; j>=0; j--)
                memo[i][j] = traveller( i, j, m, n, memo);
        }

        return memo[0][0];
    }
};
