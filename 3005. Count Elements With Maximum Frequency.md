# 3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency
---

# Intuition

HashMap

# Approach

We forst create a map of type `map<int, int> freq`.
Then we iterate over the array, by increasing the frequencies of each element in the map.
While iterating ove rthe array, we also check if the frequency of the element is higher then the current maxOccurance,`i.e. if(freq[nums[i]]) > maxOccurance`.
If it is grater, then we update the maxOccurance,`maxOccurance = freq[nums[i]]`.
And along with it, we also set the current number of elements with the maximum occurance to `0`,`i.e. count = 0`, as the `maxOccurance` has been updated.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)

- Space complexity: O(n)

# Code

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequencyElements(vector<int>& nums) {

        map<int, int> freq;
        int n= nums.size(), maxOccurance= 0, count= 0;

        for(int i=0 ; i<n ; i++ ) {

            freq[nums[i]]++;
            if(freq[nums[i]] > maxOccurance) {
                maxOccurance = freq[nums[i]];
                count = 0;
            }

            if(freq[nums[i]] == maxOccurance)
                count += freq[nums[i]];
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```
