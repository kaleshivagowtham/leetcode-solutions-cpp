# 997. Find the Town Judge
---

# Intuition
Iteration or using Graph concept

# Approach
We create 2 vectors of integer, ```trusted``` and ```trustedBy``` of size ```n```.
```trusted``` is used for storing the number of people trusting the person ```i```.
```trustedBy``` is used for storing the number of people that the person ```i``` trusts.

Now we iterate over the ```trust``` vector and keep increasing the respective values for ```trusted``` and ```trustedBy``` arrays for each person.
And since the people are from ```1 to n```, we give them the space of ```i-1``` to each person in the above arrays we created.

At the end we just iterate over both the arrays and find the person who has ```trusted[i] == 0```(condition 1) and ```trustedBy[i] == n-1```(condition 2, as all but the judge himself is to be considered here).

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(2*n)

- Space complexity: O(2*n)

Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        
        vector<int> trusted(n,0);
        vector<int> trustedBy(n,0);

        for(int i = 0; i<trust.size() ; i++) {
            int j = --trust[i][0];
            int k = --trust[i][1];
            trusted[j]++;
            trustedBy[k]++;
        }

        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
            if(trustedBy[i] >= n-1 && trusted[i] == 0)
                return i+1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
