# 1750. Minimum Length of String After Deleting Similar Ends
---

# Intuition
Two pointer approach

# Approach
Take 2 variables `i` and `j`. Place i at the start of the string,`i.e. i = 0 ` and j at the end of the string `i.e. j = s.length()-1`.

Now while `s[i] != s[j]` break the loop and `return j-i+1`, which is the length of the string that should remain. We are returning `j-i+1` since we are not editing the string (as it will take more time in each editing function), and rather considering the string to be only from `current i` to `current j` in each iteration.

And once the `i` and `j` iterate for same values, we go to the next variable i.e. `i++` and `j--` instead of editing the string.

`Try it with the string to understand better: "aabccabba"`

- Time complexity: O(n)

- Space complexity: O(1)

# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {

        int i=0,j=s.length()-1;

        while(s.length() > 1 && i<j) {

            if(s[i] != s[j])
                break;

            while(i+1 < j && i+1 < s.length() && s[i] == s[i+1])
                i++;

            while(j-1 > 0 && j-1 > i && s[j] == s[j-1])
                j--;

            if(s[i] == s[j]) {
                i++;
                j--;
            }
        }

        return j-i+1;
    }
};
