# 63. Unique Paths II

# Intuition
Dynamic Programming

# Approach
First let us build a matrix of `m x n` dimenssions.
The number of ways from each block in the matrix should be the sum of the number of ways from its right block + from its below block,
i.e. `no. of ways from i,j` = `no. of ways from i+1,j` + `no. of ways from i,j+1`.

But this would have recursive issue, so we will update the no. of ways from each block to the right most at that block itself.
And we start from the right-bottom block`i.e. [m-1][n-1]`, so as to write a memoization based code.

And for the case where `obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1`, we will directly set it to 0, rather than calculating the no. of paths from it.
Look at the conditions within the for loops in the `uniquePathsWithObstacles()`.

```
class Solution {
    long long int traveller(int i, int j, int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<long long int>>& memo) {

        if(i >= m || j >= n || grid[i][j] == 1)
            return 0;
        
        if(i == m-1 && j == n-1)
            return 1;

        long long int  val1 = i+1 < m && memo[i+1][j] ? memo[i+1][j] : traveller(i+1, j, m, n, grid, memo);
        long long int val2 = j+1 < n && memo[i][j+1] ? memo[i][j+1] : traveller(i, j+1, m, n, grid, memo);
        return val1 + val2;
    }
public:
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& obstacleGrid) {
        
        int m = obstacleGrid.size(), n = obstacleGrid[0].size();
        vector<vector<long long int>> memo(m, vector<long long int >(n,0));

        for(int i = m-1; i > -1 ; i--) {
            for(int j = n-1; j > -1 ; j--) {
                if(obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1)
                    memo[i][j] = 0;
                else
                    memo[i][j] = traveller( i, j, m, n, obstacleGrid, memo);
            }
        }

        return memo[0][0];
    }
};
